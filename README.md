## Use GitPod.io

With Gitpod you get a free "pop up" dev environment.
Just register at gitpod with your github account and create a new workspace from your fork.

Steps to do:
- Fork this page to your own Github account
- Register at Gitpod.io with your github account
- Create a new workspace with the url to your fork.

Gitpod will now automatically set up a full development environment with a running development server
and a full functioning VSCode.

After the startup of the development web server in your Terminal, you can open the page preview.

To open the preview of the robotframework.org page, which you are developing, you can just follow the link in the terminal
of the started VSCode.
Just click on `http://localhost:8080/` with the modifier CTRL (Windows & Linux) or CMD (Mac).

Once you are done with your changes you can commit your modifications to your fork and
create a pull-request to the original repository.
