currently have our own `get_timestamp` function for getting the current timestamp and `get_elapsed_time` for calculating the difference between two timestamps as milliseconds.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> t1 = get_timestamp()\r\n>>> t2 = get_timestamp()\r\n>>> print(t1)\r\n20220308 12:37:43.875\r\n>>> print(t2)\r\n20220308 12:37:49.022\r\n>>> get_elapsed_time(t1, t2)\r\n5147\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe should replace these custom functions with functionality provided by Python's standard [datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) module. In practice we could get the current time by using `datetime.now()` and could calculate the elapsed time by simply subtracting `datetime` objects:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> d1 = datetime.now()\r\n>>> d2 = datetime.now()\r\n>>> print(d1)\r\n2022-03-08 12:43:56.109349\r\n>>> print(d2)\r\n2022-03-08 12:44:03.567573\r\n>>> delta = d2 - d1\r\n>>> round(delta.total_seconds() * 1000)\r\n7458\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne benefit of using the standard `datetime` module would be that we could remove lot of our custom code. A bigger benefit is performance measured here using [timeit](https://docs.python.org/3/library/timeit.html):\r\n```python\r\n>>> timeit(lambda: get_timestamp())\r\n1.0487582740024664\r\n>>> timeit(lambda: datetime.now())\r\n0.2848877740034368\r\n>>> timeit(lambda: get_elapsed_time(t1, t2))\r\n5.105318886999157\r\n>>> timeit(lambda: round((d2-d1).total_seconds() * 1000))\r\n0.24636966099205893\r\n```\r\nAs can seen from the examples, the difference in performance is pretty big when getting the timestamp and rather huge when calculating the elapsed time. These tests each run one million iterations, so the time for one iteration isn't huge and this doesn't matter much with smallish test/task runs. With bigger runs containing e.g. loops times start to add, though, because we call `get_timestamp` twice and `get_elapsed_time` once for each keyword, loop iteration, IF/ELSE branch, and so on.

In most cases there's no difference, but in some case being able to write to the stdin of the started process can be handy. Our own acceptance tests use this functionality and it's possible/likely that also others are using it. We made stdin configurable in RF 4.1.2 (#4102) so if the pipe behavior is desired, `stdin=PIPE` can be used explicitly.\r\n\r\nI think we can change this already in RF 5.0 because it's unlikely many users are affected and `stdin=PIPE` can be used explicitly.

That has worked very well, and it would be nice if something like that would work also with variables defined in test data. We probably could re-use the underlying argument conversion logic which ought to make it relatively easy to implement this. We also got a similar request related to variables passed from the command line #2946.\r\n\r\nAutomatically converting numbers like `42` and `3.14` to actual integers/floats would be handy, even when we already support them as variables like `${42}` and `${3.14}`. Being able to use datatime objects, bytes, and other types supported by the argument conversion that don't have direct variable alternatives would naturally be even more useful (but also less commonly needed). I would expect this to be most useful with lists and dictionaries and especially with nested list and dicts that cannot easily be constructed in Robot's data.\r\n\r\nMy proposed syntax for this functionality is supporting \"type postfix\" like `:int` in variable names like this:\r\n\r\n```robotframework\r\n*** Variables ***\r\n${COUNT:int}         42\r\n${GOOD IDEA:bool}    Yes    # Converted to Boolean True\r\n${ANIMALS:list}      ['cat', 'dog', 'horse']    # Python syntax\r\n${NESTED:dict}       {'a': 1, 'b': [{'x': 2}, {'x': 3}]}    # Great with JSON\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis syntax is derived from Python's function annotation syntax and also the same syntax that was decided to be used with command line variables in #2946. Variable names would naturally be created without the type prefix like `${COUNT}` and `${GOOD IDEA}`.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being available in the variable section, the new syntax should also be available also when creating variable otherwise, including in keyword arguments:\r\n\r\n```robotframework\r\n*** Keywords ***\r\nExample\r\n    [Arguments]    ${count:int}\r\n    ${nested:dict} =    Set Variable    {'a': ${count}, 'b': [{'x': 2}, {'x': 3}]}\r\n    Set Test Variable    ${DATE:datetime}     2019-08-23 12:03:42\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are some design decision still to be made like should `${X:dict}` create a `DotDict` instance that allows `${X.key}` syntax and how to handle possible backwards incompatibility issues. For most parts the design looks pretty good, though, and I think this would be a valuable addition to Robot Framework. If there's enough interest, we can consider adding this already to RF 3.2 scope.

It would allow using keywords in places where currently you'd normally just have plain strings (or variables).

A sample project structure (using `poetry`) could look like this:\r\n```\r\nsrc/\r\n-- RobotFrameworkResources/\r\n---- keywords/\r\n------ __init__.py\r\n------ Web.resource\r\n---- variables/\r\n------ __init__.py\r\n------ Urls.resource\r\n---- __init__.py\r\n-- __init__.py\r\npyproject.toml\r\n```\r\nThe part of the `pyproject.toml` for what to package would look like this (`[tool.poetry]` section):\r\n``` toml\r\npackages = [\r\n    { include = \"RobotFrameworkResources\", from = \"src\" },\r\n]\r\ninclude = [\"*.resource\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nA simple `poetry build` will generate the `.whl` and `.tar.gz` in the `dist` folder and can be distributed through regular means (`poetry publish` to upload to pypi or private tracker, adding them to a GitHub release, etc.).\r\n\r\nNow where enhancement would be beneficial, is where the distributed resources would be used. Currently, getting access to the `Keywords` in the `Web.resource` would look like this:\r\n``` robotframework\r\n*** Settings ***\r\nResource    RobotFrameworkResources/keywords/Web.resource\r\n\r\n*** Test Cases ***\r\nOpen the website\r\n    Open main site\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe disadvantage here is that the user of the resource package needs to know the internal structure of the distribution (`/keywords/`) and the extension of the resource file has to be specified.\r\n\r\nAn improved `Resource` import statement, more like the `Library` statement would be beneficial:\r\n``` robotframework\r\n*** Settings ***\r\nLibrary  Collections\r\nLibrary  RPA.Archive\r\nResource    Web\r\nResource    RobotFrameworkResource.Urls\r\n```\r\n\r\nPoints for consideration:\r\n\r\n- Which extensions to support? For initial implementation, I would choose `.resource` for simplicity / clarity.\r\n- LSP / linter support\r\n- How to allow package developers to \"wire\" the internal package (folder) structure to the desired Resource import statements\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\nAdditional thoughts:\r\n\r\n- How would package / library documentation be accessible to the user of the resource package? If the source package is not on GitHub or similar, any documentation distributed with the package (by, e.g. packaging `.md` or `.html` files) would be somewhere within a virtual environment / Python install folder of the user. How can we show this documentation?\r\n    - perhaps the module docstring of the package can be shown by an LSP\r\n\r\n@pekkaklarck From your Slack response, perhaps an idea is to follow the generic RF arguments syntax to allow users to specify which resources to import (no argument meaning \"import all resources found in the package\"):\r\n``` robotframework\r\n*** Settings ***\r\nResource    RobotFrameworkResource  # import all resources found in the resource package\r\n```\r\n``` robotframework\r\n*** Settings ***\r\nResource    RobotFrameworkResource    Web.resource    Api.resource  # import only the specified resource files\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4317/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4317/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4312","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4312/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4312/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4312/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4312","id":1202018034,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85HpVby","number":4312,"title":"Add project URLs to PyPI","user":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013647,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430378,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20medium","name":"priority: medium","color":"238b45","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/61","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/61","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/61/labels","id":7269150,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84Abuse","number":61,"title":"v5.1","description":"New feature release with main focus in improving support for other languages than English.

Using them fails with a message telling that the keyword name is reserved and some keywords also instruct how to use the actual `FOR`, `IF`, etc. syntax.\r\n\r\nWe added the library ages ago to avoid problems if new syntax is added. Now all the syntax there (and more!) has been added so there's no need to reserve anything. When we added `IF` in RF 4.0, we also made a decision to require all this kind of syntax to be upper case. That makes it mostly unnecessary to reserve possible new syntax because even if we'd add something like `CASE`, there would be no problem using keyword `Case`.\r\n\r\nWhen this library is removed, using a keyword like `Continue` will continue to fail, but the error message changes from `'Continue' is a reserved keyword.` to `No keyword with name 'Continue' found.`. With keywords containing usage instructions, like `If` that currently fails like `'If' is a reserved keyword. It must be an upper case 'IF' when used as a marker.`, the new error isn't as informative as earlier. I would say we can nowadays expect users to know that this kind of syntax must be upper case so this isn't a big deal. If we were to report such errors to users, we should detect them already at parsing time anyway to make errors easily available for IDEs and other tools using Robot's parsing modules.\r\n\r\nA benefit of removing the Reserved library is that in some contexts the current custom error message is pretty confusing.

For example,\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef do_something():\r\n    do_first_thing('example')\r\n    do_second_thing()\r\n```\r\nwill in the log file be shown as a single keyword without any child keywords. It is possible to use `BuiltIn.run_keyword` to execute other keywords so that they are shown as child keywords and #4237 discusses better APIs for that usage.\r\n\r\nA problem with using `BuiltIn.run_keyword` is that keywords executed with it must be available as normal keywords either in the library running other keywords or in some other imported library. That's ok if keywords are usable on their own, but it is possible that child keywords cannot be used like that. This problem can be avoided by making it possible to run any callable as the [final proposal](https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4237#issuecomment-1058077142) in #4237 suggests. There could, however, be even better solutions for the underlying need.\r\n\r\nA solution I have been thinking is is using a context manager that would create a keyword in log (and in output.xml). We probably could use our existing `robot.running.Keyword` for that purpose. The usage could be something like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef do_something():\r\n    with Keyword('Do first thing', args=['example'], doc='Example'):\r\n        do_first_thing()\r\n    with Keyword('Do second thing'):\r\n        print('No need to call a method, implementation can be directly inside the context manager!')\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese are the main benefits of this approach compared to `BuitlIn.run_keyword` would be:\r\n1. No need to expose child keywords as real keywords.\r\n2. No need to even make each child keyword a callable. Implementation could be directly inside the context manager.\r\n3. It would be possible to add documentation, tags, etc. to be shown in the log file.\r\n\r\nPoints 1. and 3. would be possible also with `execute_keyword` proposed in #4237. Executing other keywords has also other use cases than logging child keywords, so #4237 is likely needed anyway. It's not certain is 2. alone worth enough to implement this feature. Possibly using a context manager could result with cleaner code, though.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4252/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4252/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4237","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4237/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4237/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4237/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4237","id":1140704583,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85D_cVH","number":4237,"title":"Better API for library keywords to execute other keywords","user":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013647,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430354,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20high","name":"priority: high","color":"006d2c","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/61","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/61","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/61/labels","id":7269150,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84Abuse","number":61,"title":"v5.1","description":"New feature release with main focus in improving support for other languages than English.

One good example is SeleniumLibrary, that makes it possible to register a keyword that will be executed if any of its own keywords fails. Sometimes, especially when doing task automation, it is also beneficial to log actions done by the keyword in the log file separately. For example,\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef do_something():\r\n    do_first_thing()\r\n    do_second_thing()\r\n```\r\nwill in the log file be shown as a single keyword without any child keywords, but there are sometimes needs to show `do_first_thing` and `do_second_thing` as child keywords.\r\n\r\nNowadays keywords can execute other keywords by using `BuiltIn.run_keyword`. It works but has several problems:\r\n\r\n1. Arguments are resolved twice. This  means replacing variables and handling syntax like `\\n`. For example, if we have a keyword like\r\n    ```python\r\n    def example(arg):\r\n        BuiltIn().run_keyword('Log To Console', arg)\r\n    ```\r\n    and call it like\r\n    ```\r\n    Example    c:\\\\temp\r\n    ```\r\n    the actually logged string has a tab character. The reason is that `\\\\t` is first resolved to string `\\t` which is then on the second round resolved to a tab.\r\n\r\n    Double resolving can be avoided be registering the keyword to be a \"run keyword variant\", but that API isn't really public and it's also pretty bad in general. We have #2190 about enhancing it and making it public, but it would probably be better to avoid this double resolving altogether.\r\n\r\n2. Related to above, the keyword using `BuiltIn.run_keyword` cannot safely call it without escaping strings. For example, something like `BuiltIn.run_keyword('Log To Console', 'c:\\\\temp')` won't work correctly and the argument should be `c:\\\\\\\\temp` instead.\r\n\r\n3. `BuiltIn.run_keyword` only accepts positional arguments. For example, if we had a keyword implemented like\r\n    ```pyhton\r\n    def example(upper=False):\r\n        ...\r\n    ```\r\n    we couldn't call it like `BuiltIn.run_keyword('Example', upper=True)` but instead needed to use `BuiltIn.run_keywod('Example', 'upper=True')`.\r\n\r\nThe above examples ought to make it clear that a better API is needed.

A problem with detecting errors only at the execution time is that they aren't reported to tools like editor plugins that use Robot's parser. We should thus move error detection to parser as much as possible. This includes at least these cases:\r\n\r\n- Empty test and keyword.\r\n- `END`, `ELSE`, `ELSE IF`, `EXCEPT` or `FINALLY` when there is no matching parent element like `IF` or `TRY`.\r\n- ~`RETURN` used in test.~ Fixed already in RF 5.0.\r\n- ~`BREAK/CONTINUE` outside loops.~ Fixed already in RF 5.0.\r\n- ~`RETURN/BREAK/CONTINUE` in `FINALLY`.~ Fixed already in RF 5.0.\r\n\r\nWe also have a similar problem that some of the error situations detected by the parser are not detected as early as they could be. For example, having `IF` with more than one condition is detected by the parser when the parsing model is validated, but the underlying tokens do not get `ERROR` type. This is a problem if only using tokens (i.e. when using `get_tokens`, not `get_model`) and also when using the model it would be more convenient if invalid tokens could be easily detected. This problem occurs at least in these cases:\r\n\r\n- `IF`, `ELSE IF` and `WHILE` with more than one condition.\r\n- `ELSE`, `END`, `BREAK`, `CONTINUE`, `TRY` and `FINALLY` with values.\r\n- `AS` with invalid variable or with more than one variable.\r\n\r\nBecause these latter errors are detected by the parser, only a bit late, I don't consider this limitation as bad as the problem with the earlier errors.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4210/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4210/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4170","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4170/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4170/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4170/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4170","id":1080815625,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85Aa_AJ","number":4170,"title":"Tests that are not run due to earlier fatal error should get SKIP status, not FAIL","user":{"login":"dgalezow","id":48494061,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NDk0MDYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48494061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgalezow","html_url":"https://github.com/dgalezow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgalezow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgalezow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgalezow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgalezow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgalezow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgalezow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgalezow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgalezow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgalezow/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013647,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430378,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20medium","name":"priority: medium","color":"238b45","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/61","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/61","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/61/labels","id":7269150,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84Abuse","number":61,"title":"v5.1","description":"New feature release with main focus in improving support for other languages than English.

For example:\r\n```\r\n*** Settings ***\r\nDocumentation     Some doc here.\r\n```\r\nSupporting other languages would be great. For example, the above could look like this in Finnish:\r\n```\r\n*** Asetukset ***\r\nDokumentaatio    Jotain dokua täällä.\r\n```\r\n\r\nGetting this done requires:\r\n1. Deciding how to enable support for different languages. Probably with a command line option like `--language FI`.\r\n2. Deciding how to handle multiple languages in one execution. Could be `--language FI --language EN` to allow customizing how a certain language is used e.g. like `--language FI:some:config`.\r\n3. Deciding what to translate. Section headers and settings for sure, but what about control structures like IF/ELSE? Perhaps we should allow translating everything and let translators to select do they want to use common IF/ELSE or some local variant. Could also be customizable when enabling support for a certain language.\r\n4. Getting translations for built-in support for common languages. These can be added in future releases.\r\n5. Deciding how to use languages that don't have built-in support. Perhaps `--language mylang.txt`.\r\n\r\nI hope the wider community can help with translations when we get that far. Comments about the design decisions above are appreciated as well.\r\n\r\nI consider making Robot Framework more native in non-English speaking languages pretty important and thus assign this to RF 5.0 scope with critical priority. The old issue about non-English Given/When/Then prefixes (#519) is highly related and already in RF 5.0 scope.\r\n\r\nThere are many other related enhancements like translating log and report, translating error message, translating keywords used in generic libraries, and so on. They all require their own issues and probably need to wait for future RF versions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4096/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4096/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4069","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4069/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4069/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4069/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4069","id":980011349,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU5ODAwMTEzNDk=","number":4069,"title":"Variables acting as embedded arguments are not checked against regular expression","user":{"login":"MoreFamed","id":82573620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNTczNjIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/82573620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoreFamed","html_url":"https://github.com/MoreFamed","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoreFamed/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoreFamed/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoreFamed/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoreFamed/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoreFamed/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoreFamed/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoreFamed/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoreFamed/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoreFamed/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013647,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430378,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20medium","name":"priority: medium","color":"238b45","default":false,"description":""},{"id":809830686,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MDk4MzA2ODY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/good%20first%20issue","name":"good first issue","color":"7057ff","default":true,"description":"Good for newcomers"}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/61","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/61","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/61/labels","id":7269150,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84Abuse","number":61,"title":"v5.1","description":"New feature release with main focus in improving support for other languages than English.

All variables can be overridden with locally created variables. For example, in the \"Variable section\" test below `${42}` is overridden but `${TRUE}` is not and in the \"Local variables\" test both are overridden.\r\n\r\n```\r\n*** Variables ***\r\n${42}            Overridden\r\n${TRUE}          Not overridden\r\n\r\n*** Test Cases ***\r\nVariable section\r\n    Log to console    ${42}\r\n    Log to console    ${TRUE}\r\n\r\nLocal variables\r\n    ${42} =      Set variable    Overridden again\r\n    ${TRUE} =    Set variable    Overridden this time\r\n    Log to console    ${42}\r\n    Log to console    ${TRUE}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason that `${42}` can be overridden in the Variables section is that it doesn't actually exist initially. The value is created dynamically when the variable is used if a variable with that name doesn't exist. In the example above such a variable is created and it is used instead. Built-in variables that are initialized before execution starts cannot currently be overridden except when creating local variables.\r\n\r\nNot being able to override built-in variables, especially variables like in the above example, could be considered a good idea, but it causes problems when we add new built-in variables. For example, newly added `&{OPTIONS}` (#4229) overrides variables with the same name (incl. `${options}`) as explained in #4274. I believe the best way to avoid these problems is that we make it possible to override all built-in variables.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4279/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4279/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4275","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4275/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4275/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4275/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4275","id":1169079912,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85Frr5o","number":4275,"title":"Libdoc does not support specifying argument types using new `arg: X | Y` syntax","user":{"login":"DetachHead","id":57028336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MDI4MzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57028336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DetachHead","html_url":"https://github.com/DetachHead","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DetachHead/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DetachHead/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DetachHead/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DetachHead/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DetachHead/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DetachHead/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DetachHead/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DetachHead/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DetachHead/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110430378,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20medium","name":"priority: medium","color":"238b45","default":false,"description":""},{"id":110430429,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzA0Mjk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/task","name":"task","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":"Generic task not listed in release notes"},{"id":230194665,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMzAxOTQ2NjU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/rc%202","name":"rc 2","color":"ffffff","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/52","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/52","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/52/labels","id":5081658,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTA4MTY1OA==","number":52,"title":"v5.0","description":"New major release concentrating on adding new syntax to Robot Framework language: `TRY/EXCEPT` (#3075), `WHILE` (#4084), inline `IF` (#4093), `RETURN` (#4078) as well as `BREAK` and `CONTINUE` (#4079).

It always rounds half values up (e.g. 0.5 -> 1, 1.5 -> 2) same way as `round` on Python 2 does. On Python 3 `round` uses \"bankers rounding\" algorithm and rounds every second half value down and every second up (e.g. 0.5 -> 0, 1.5 -> 2). There was some merit in using the more familiar rounding algorithm used with Python 2, but the approach used by Python 3 is generally considered better. Using the current Python standard is probably better for us and the built-in `round` is certainly faster.\r\n\r\nAnother reason to use `roundup` was that it preserved the original input type when it didn't remove precision. For example, `roundup(110, -2)` yields `100`, not `100.0`, like `round` with Python 2 does. Python 3 `round` preserves the input type the same way as `roundup` so this isn't a valid reason anymore.\r\n\r\nThis is mostly an internal change, but can naturally affect users if they use keywords doing rounding. For example, `Should Be Equal As Numbers` supports precision that's used for rounding input values before comparison and that is affected. For example, after this change\r\n\r\n```\r\nShould Be Equal As Numbers    135    145    precision=-1\r\n```\r\n\r\nsucceeds because both values are rounded to 140. That's somewhat unfortunate, but I still believe using the same rounding approach Python does is a good idea.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4267/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4267/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4266","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4266/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4266/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4266/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4266","id":1165197020,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85Fc37c","number":4266,"title":"Remove deprecated `robot.variables.is_var` and similar functions","user":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013647,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430514,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzA1MTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20low","name":"priority: low","color":"41ae76","default":false,"description":""},{"id":113657783,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTM2NTc3ODM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/backwards%20incompatible","name":"backwards incompatible","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":229188865,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjkxODg4NjU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/rc%201","name":"rc 1","color":"ffffff","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/52","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/52","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/52/labels","id":5081658,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTA4MTY1OA==","number":52,"title":"v5.0","description":"New major release concentrating on adding new syntax to Robot Framework language: `TRY/EXCEPT` (#3075), `WHILE` (#4084), inline `IF` (#4093), `RETURN` (#4078) as well as `BREAK` and `CONTINUE` (#4079).

Now that we validate options passed to `robot.run/rebot` (#4212), `pythonpath` not being accepted by `RobotSettings` causes problems with Pabot (https://github.com/mkorpela/pabot/issues/450). This problem can be avoided by handling `pythonpath` as other normal options. Instead of processing it already in `ArgumentParser` it should be passed to `RobotSettings` and then later read from there.\r\n\r\nAs part of this change, `auto_pythonpath` argument accepted by `ArgumentParser` needs to be deprecated. `ArgumentParser` resides under `robot.utils` and is thus considered to be part of the public API and removing an option accepted by it would thus be a backwards incompatible change.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4239/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4239/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4235","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4235/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4235/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4235/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4235","id":1139789328,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85D784Q","number":4235,"title":"Update

Bug description\r\n\r\n`robot` is now emitting errors for unrecognized reST directives beginning in v4.1.2, even though the directives are not inside the `robotframework` code block. The errors do not cause the `robot` process to fail, but they do clutter up the console.\r\n\r\nThis issue was introduced by the changes in #4085 .
