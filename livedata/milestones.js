It would avoid problems like in #4065 and be the same as the default behavior of the underlying [subprocess.Popen](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen).\r\n\r\nThe problem with this change is that it can cause backwards compatibility problems. In most cases there's no difference, but in some case being able to write to the stdin of the started process can be handy. Our own acceptance tests use this functionality and it's possible/likely that also others are using it. We made stdin configurable in RF 4.1.2 (#4102) so if the pipe behavior is desired, `stdin=PIPE` can be used explicitly.\r\n\r\nI think we can change this already in RF 5.0 because it's unlikely many users are affected and `stdin=PIPE` can be used explicitly.

That has worked very well, and it would be nice if something like that would work also with variables defined in test data. We probably could re-use the underlying argument conversion logic which ought to make it relatively easy to implement this. We also got a similar request related to variables passed from the command line #2946.\r\n\r\nAutomatically converting numbers like `42` and `3.14` to actual integers/floats would be handy, even when we already support them as variables like `${42}` and `${3.14}`. Being able to use datatime objects, bytes, and other types supported by the argument conversion that don't have direct variable alternatives would naturally be even more useful (but also less commonly needed). I would expect this to be most useful with lists and dictionaries and especially with nested list and dicts that cannot easily be constructed in Robot's data.\r\n\r\nMy proposed syntax for this functionality is supporting \"type postfix\" like `:int` in variable names like this:\r\n\r\n```robotframework\r\n*** Variables ***\r\n${COUNT:int}         42\r\n${GOOD IDEA:bool}    Yes    # Converted to Boolean True\r\n${ANIMALS:list}      ['cat', 'dog', 'horse']    # Python syntax\r\n${NESTED:dict}       {'a': 1, 'b': [{'x': 2}, {'x': 3}]}    # Great with JSON\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis syntax is derived from Python's function annotation syntax and also the same syntax that was decided to be used with command line variables in #2946. Variable names would naturally be created without the type prefix like `${COUNT}` and `${GOOD IDEA}`.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being available in the variable section, the new syntax should also be available also when creating variable otherwise, including in keyword arguments:\r\n\r\n```robotframework\r\n*** Keywords ***\r\nExample\r\n    [Arguments]    ${count:int}\r\n    ${nested:dict} =    Set Variable    {'a': ${count}, 'b': [{'x': 2}, {'x': 3}]}\r\n    Set Test Variable    ${DATE:datetime}     2019-08-23 12:03:42\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are some design decision still to be made like should `${X:dict}` create a `DotDict` instance that allows `${X.key}` syntax and how to handle possible backwards incompatibility issues. For most parts the design looks pretty good, though, and I think this would be a valuable addition to Robot Framework. If there's enough interest, we can consider adding this already to RF 3.2 scope.

Being able to do something like this is a pretty common request:\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   *** Variables ***\r\n   ${EXAMPLE} =         Keyword    argument\r\n   ```\r\n\r\nThe hardest thing related to this issue is coming up with a good syntax. I've been thinking about this for some time and have some ideas but no clear candidate I like best. I'll explain these ideas in separate comments below. :+1: and :-1: reactions, comments and other syntax ideas are all highly appreciated!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/3187/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/3187/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1}]}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/52","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/52","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/52/labels","id":5081658,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTA4MTY1OA==","number":52,"title":"v5.0","description":"New major release with still open scope and timeline.

When saving Libdoc model to an XML spec, parts of the model are incorrectly modified in place. More precisely, Boolean telling is TypedDict data types item required or not is converted to string `'true'` or `'false'`. In practice this would cause problems only if model would be saved again which doesn't happen when using Libdoc from the command line.\r\n2. When creating a model based on an XML spec, keyword source information is not set correctly it it has been same as library source when the spec was generated.\r\n\r\nThe latter problem is due to our decision not to include keyword source into XML spec files if it is same as the library source to avoid duplicate information. When a model is generated based on a spec, we should use library's source as the default for keyword source. This can result with wrong information added to keywords in cases where keyword source wasn't initially available at all. That's rather rare and keyword source pointing to the library in these cases shouldn't be a big problem anyway.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4159/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4159/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4150","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4150/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4150/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4150/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4150","id":1062664308,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ84_Vvh0","number":4150,"title":"Deprecate old Python 2/3 compatibility layer","user":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013647,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430378,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20medium","name":"priority: medium","color":"238b45","default":false,"description":""},{"id":121827221,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjE4MjcyMjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/deprecation","name":"deprecation","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/52","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/52","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/52/labels","id":5081658,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTA4MTY1OA==","number":52,"title":"v5.0","description":"New major release with still open scope and timeline.

There are, however, various tools and libraries that use Robot's Python 2/3 compatibility layer and removing it altogether would break all of them. These tools/libs being Python 3 compatible themselves doesn't change that: if they use Robot's API that we remove, they will break.\r\n\r\nWe could just say that all tools/libs that are compatible with RF 5 should be Python-3-only and shouldn't use the old compatibility layer. Most likely most of them would be updated soon, but there likely are various projects that aren't actively maintained and updating could take time and in the worst case require finding a new maintainer. Breaking lot of projects isn't great, and in this case we can easily avoid that by preserving at least the most important parts of the compatibility layer. I strongly believe that's a good idea, especially because doing that is pretty easy.\r\n\r\nAlthough I think we should preserve the compatibility layer, I don't believe we should preserve it fully. The reason is that there are some utils that exists only to workaround bugs in old Jython and IronPython versions that nobody should be using anymore anyway. Some other utils are so specialized that I don't believe they are used at all. I believe we should preserve the most important parts and then add more utils back during the RF 5 preview release time or even after RF 5.0 release if needed.\r\n\r\nThis is what I think we should preserve:\r\n- `PY2`, `PY3`, `JYTHON`, `IRONPYTHON` and `JAVA_VERSION` constants\r\n- `py2to3` and `py3to2` class decorators\r\n- `is_unicode` function (could be an alias for `is_string`)\r\n- `unicode` type (could be an alias for `str`)\r\n- `unic` for safely converting values to Unicode (we still need this utility but it has been renamed to `safe_str`)\r\n\r\nThe following utils are likely not used a lot or at all. They can be preserved if needed:\r\n- `with_metaclass` for applying a metaclass\r\n- `StringIO` (`io.StringIO` works in most cases also with Python 2)\r\n- `Mapping` and `MutableMapping` (available in `collections` until Python 3.10)\r\n- `unwrap` for unwrapping decorators (available in `inspect` in Python 3)\r\n- `is_java_init` and `is_java_method` for detecting Java based methods\r\n\r\nI believe it's enough to document that the preserved utils are deprecated in RF 5. We can then later decide should we somehow more visible deprecate them. That would be pretty easy with functions but constants are a bit trickier. Most likely there's no actual maintenance or performance burden from preserving these utils so there's no urgent need to remove them either.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4150/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4150/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4149","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4149/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4149/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4149/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4149","id":1057867939,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ84_Dcij","number":4149,"title":"Improve Readability and Visual of UserGuide","user":{"login":"Snooz82","id":41592183,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNTkyMTgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41592183?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Snooz82","html_url":"https://github.com/Snooz82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Snooz82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Snooz82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Snooz82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Snooz82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Snooz82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Snooz82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Snooz82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Snooz82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Snooz82/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013647,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430378,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20medium","name":"priority: medium","color":"238b45","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/52","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/52","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/52/labels","id":5081658,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTA4MTY1OA==","number":52,"title":"v5.0","description":"New major release with still open scope and timeline.

Documentation has recommended using `formatter` already earlier, but now it's time to deprecated it more loudly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4142/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4142/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4134","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4134/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4134/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4134/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4134","id":1044884102,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ84-R6qG","number":4134,"title":"Assigments can have extra `=` in log if executed keyword does not exist","user":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013645,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"d73a4a","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430514,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzA1MTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20low","name":"priority: low","color":"41ae76","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/52","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/52","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/52/labels","id":5081658,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTA4MTY1OA==","number":52,"title":"v5.0","description":"New major release with still open scope and timeline.

But because registered keyword arguments can be almost anything, Browser library can not define typing for the arguments and therefore Robot Framework can not perform automatic conversion to the arguments. There is an [issue](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-browser/issues/1356) which demonstrates the problem when we do not perform the conversion. \r\n\r\nTherefore I was thinking to do conversion inside of the library.  I think it can be done if the run on failure keyword is one of the browser library keywords, because then library knows the argument specification. But the argument conversion is pretty complex problem to do, so I was thinking that I could use some Robot Framework code. Is there some entry point which would allow to do the conversion easily?

For example, the above could look like this in Finnish:\r\n```\r\n*** Asetukset ***\r\nDokumentaatio    Jotain dokua täällä.\r\n```\r\n\r\nGetting this done requires:\r\n1. Deciding how to enable support for different languages. Probably with a command line option like `--language FI`.\r\n2. Deciding how to handle multiple languages in one execution. Could be `--language FI --language EN` to allow customizing how a certain language is used e.g. like `--language FI:some:config`.\r\n3. Deciding what to translate. Section headers and settings for sure, but what about control structures like IF/ELSE? Perhaps we should allow translating everything and let translators to select do they want to use common IF/ELSE or some local variant. Could also be customizable when enabling support for a certain language.\r\n4. Getting translations for built-in support for common languages. These can be added in future releases.\r\n5. Deciding how to use languages that don't have built-in support. Perhaps `--language mylang.txt`.\r\n\r\nI hope the wider community can help with translations when we get that far. Comments about the design decisions above are appreciated as well.\r\n\r\nI consider making Robot Framework more native in non-English speaking languages pretty important and thus assign this to RF 5.0 scope with critical priority. The old issue about non-English Given/When/Then prefixes (#519) is highly related and already in RF 5.0 scope.\r\n\r\nThere are many other related enhancements like translating log and report, translating error message, translating keywords used in generic libraries, and so on.

This can make it difficult to diagnose test failures when multiple threads are involved, even with the use of the [`robotbackgroundlogger`](https://github.com/robotframework/robotbackgroundlogger).\r\n\r\nFor example, testing an application which makes requests (e.g. HTTP requests) to a server, where a dummy server is run as a separate background thread by the test framework (for tracking, inspecting and validating requests, producing dummy responses etc.), it would be really helpful to have logs from the server able to be logged to the same file(s) as the Robot tests and test infrastructure themselves, in the order they were logged by the respective threads. This would make it much easier to be able to correlate the logs from the different threads and quickly identify where failures are occurring.\r\n\r\nThe key thing doing this \"natively\" in `robotframework` gives (rather than via `robotbackgroundlogger`) is that this is immediately usable by all users of the framework, and doesn't require specific additional implementation by users. It also means the logs from the various threads are correctly interleaved in the order they were logged, whereas the `robotbackgroundlogger` logs the stored logs from background threads at a later point in time, requiring more steps to be able to reconstruct events.\r\n\r\nThis issue initially tracks just implementing this for the debug file (so that there is at least one method for getting these logs), however it would be beneficial to extend this to all log files if possible.\r\n\r\nAn initial attempt at fixing this issue (for the debug file only) is in https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/pull/3917.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4092/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4092/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4088","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4088/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4088/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4088/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4088","id":996684487,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ847aDLH","number":4088,"title":"Ability to register custom converters for keyword arguments","user":{"login":"DetachHead","id":57028336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MDI4MzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57028336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DetachHead","html_url":"https://github.com/DetachHead","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DetachHead/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DetachHead/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DetachHead/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DetachHead/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DetachHead/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DetachHead/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DetachHead/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DetachHead/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DetachHead/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013647,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430421,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzA0MjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20critical","name":"priority: critical","color":"00441b","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/52","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/52","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/52/labels","id":5081658,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTA4MTY1OA==","number":52,"title":"v5.0","description":"New major release with still open scope and timeline.

I expect it to fail as if in case when the non-matching value was given to the keyword directly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4069/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4069/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4039","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4039/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4039/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4039/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4039","id":945293484,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU5NDUyOTM0ODQ=","number":4039,"title":"Include information about chained exceptions in failure tracebacks","user":{"login":"Ka55i0peia","id":1867129,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjcxMjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1867129?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ka55i0peia","html_url":"https://github.com/Ka55i0peia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ka55i0peia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ka55i0peia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ka55i0peia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ka55i0peia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ka55i0peia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ka55i0peia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ka55i0peia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ka55i0peia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ka55i0peia/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013647,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430378,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20medium","name":"priority: medium","color":"238b45","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/52","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/52","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/52/labels","id":5081658,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTA4MTY1OA==","number":52,"title":"v5.0","description":"New major release with still open scope and timeline.

That wasn't certain based on the issue description, but profiling by running `/usr/bin/time -v rebot output.xml` with `output.xml` containing 1000 dummy test cases showed that maximum memory sure enough had raised from ~102MB with RF 3.2.2 to ~123MB with RF 4.1.1. Unfortunate `/usr/bin/time -v` doesn't show where the memory is spent, but `git bisect` revealed that the commit causing pretty big increase in memory usage was 21c6b468a6f19181e44300c2be5a3fa4afd28471.\r\n\r\nThe aforementioned commit added direct `setup` and `teardown` attributes to `TestSuite` and `TestCase` objects and `teardown` to `Keyword`. That was a good change from the API point of view, but each `TestSuite` and more importantly `TestCase` always having `setup` and `teardown` that are represented as `Keyword` objects takes some memory. With `Keyword` objects `teardown` is actually only created if needed, so I figured that there wouldn't be problems with them. Reverting the API change just to make `TestCase` objects use a little less memory didn't feel like a good idea.\r\n\r\nYesterday I totally by accident encountered a Python memory profiler called [Fil](https://pythonspeed.com/fil/). I had searched for this kind of tools earlier, but hadn't found this one. It looked really promising and targeted for exactly in our kind of use case. According to Fil docs it helps us to figure out:\r\n\r\n- Where peak memory usage is, also known as the high-water mark.\r\n- What code was responsible for allocating the memory that was present at that peak moment.\r\n\r\nTurned out Fil did what it promised and I was able to find few places where we use lot of memory and where the memory usage has increased from RF 3.2.2. The biggest problems that `Keyword.teardown` that I though wouldn't matter. It's true it's only created when needed, but we accessed `kw.teardown` in few central places (e.g. in `SuiteVisitor`) and that was enough. I commit a fix to this problem and to others I encountered separately.\r\n\r\nAfter profiling and tuning the memory usage has dropped considerably on my machine. Usage reported `/usr/bin/time -v` with the same test set I used earlier is now ~83MB. That's a huge from from ~123MB with RF 4.1.1 and also a big drop from ~103MB with RF 3.2.2. If I got my math right, with this set memory usage has dropped 33% compared to RF 4.1.1 and 20% compared to RF 3.2.2.\r\n\r\nAlthough these changes are pretty small, they still require new RF 4.1.2 release candidate and may require postponing the final release few days. Considering how big enhancements are, I consider that worth it and better than waiting for RF 5.0.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4114/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4114/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4112","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4112/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4112/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4112/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4112","id":1016131986,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ848kPGS","number":4112,"title":"Incompatible output.xml created if listener runs keyword in `end_keyword` inside FOR loop","user":{"login":"Harri","id":568873,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODg3Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568873?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Harri","html_url":"https://github.com/Harri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Harri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Harri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Harri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Harri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Harri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Harri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Harri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Harri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Harri/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013645,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"d73a4a","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430378,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20medium","name":"priority: medium","color":"238b45","default":false,"description":""},{"id":230194665,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMzAxOTQ2NjU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/rc%202","name":"rc 2","color":"ffffff","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/60","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/60","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/60/labels","id":7114136,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84AbI2Y","number":60,"title":"v4.1.2","description":"Final planned RF 4.1.x release and thus also the final release to support Python 2.\r\n\r\nMostly a bug fix release.

The default behavior of the underlying [subprocess](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen) is to inherit stdin from the parent process, but we instead hard code it to use `subprocess.PIPE`. The current behavior makes it possible to write to the stdin of the started process which can be useful. Unfortunately it can also cause problems as  #4065 demonstrates.\r\n\r\nWe already support configuring stdout and stderr, and it would be convenient to also be able to configure stdin. Possible values could be:\r\n\r\n- `String PIPE` to explicitly use `subprocess.PIPE`.\r\n- String `NONE` (case-insensitively to allow also `None`) to get `subprocess` default behavior.\r\n- Path to a file to use that file as the stdin. We just needed to open the wile and use the opened file object as the stdin.\r\n- Any string to be passed as stdin. We needed to create a temporary file where the text is written and pass that file as the stdin.\r\n- Any non-string we could pass to `subprocess.Popen` as-is. This would allow, for example, using stdout of another process as the stdin.\r\n\r\nIt's not a good idea in general to add new functionality in patch releases like RF 4.1.2. The reason I think we should make an exception is that we cannot really fix/workaround #4065 otherwise. It could be fixed by changing our default behavior from `subprocess.PIPE` to `None`, but that would be backwards incompatible and that's absolutely not OK in a patch release. The other solution would be postponing this to RF 5.0, but I consider adding this new functionality in RF 4.1.2 better.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4102/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4102/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4100","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4100/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4100/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4100/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4100","id":1010650323,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ848PUzT","number":4100,"title":"Java versions with version number not in format `<major>.<minor>.<patch>` do not work (e.g. OpenJDK 17)","user":{"login":"csantune","id":86595939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTk1OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/86595939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantune","html_url":"https://github.com/csantune","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantune/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantune/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantune/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantune/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantune/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantune/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantune/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantune/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantune/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013645,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"d73a4a","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430421,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzA0MjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20critical","name":"priority: critical","color":"00441b","default":false,"description":""},{"id":229188865,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjkxODg4NjU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/rc%201","name":"rc 1","color":"ffffff","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/60","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/60","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/60/labels","id":7114136,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84AbI2Y","number":60,"title":"v4.1.2","description":"Final planned RF 4.1.x release and thus also the final release to support Python 2.\r\n\r\nMostly a bug fix release.

For example, exception like\r\n\r\n    raise ValueError('*HTML* This is an <b>example</b>!')\r\n\r\nwill result with this message:\r\n\r\n    ValueError: *HTML* This is an <b>example</b>!\r\n\r\nThis bug also affects the new `robot.api.FatalError` (#3685) when used like\r\n\r\n    raise FatalError('This is an <b>example</b>!', html=True)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4071/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4071/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4063","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4063/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4063/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4063/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4063","id":973298101,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU5NzMyOTgxMDE=","number":4063,"title":"`--removekeywords WUKS` can cause crash","user":{"login":"DirkRichter","id":20930315,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTMwMzE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20930315?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DirkRichter","html_url":"https://github.com/DirkRichter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DirkRichter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DirkRichter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DirkRichter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DirkRichter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DirkRichter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DirkRichter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DirkRichter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DirkRichter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DirkRichter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013645,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"d73a4a","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430378,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20medium","name":"priority: medium","color":"238b45","default":false,"description":""},{"id":229188865,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjkxODg4NjU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/rc%201","name":"rc 1","color":"ffffff","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/59","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/59","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/59/labels","id":7003563,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84Aat2r","number":59,"title":"v4.1.1","description":"Bug fix release also adding official Python 3.10 support.

In a way dry runs became incompatible with codebases with runtime-generated tags. I wonder how to proceed beyond pinning the version to 4.0 for now:\r\n- is there a way to disable running \"set tags\" (and friends) in dry mode?\r\n- is there anything else I can do to ignore failures in \"set tags\" if I don't care about absence of specific variables in dry mode?
