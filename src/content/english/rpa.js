      title: 'What is Robot Framework RPA?',
      body: `<p>RPA stands for Robotic Process Automation and it’s a method for automating routine
      tasks and processes through user interfaces, APIs, and other interactions that mimic the way
      a human user performs tasks. The power of RPA lies in how you can automate tasks without having
      to change the underlying systems.</p>

      <p>Robot Framework is a keyword-driven automation framework that sits on top of Python. It is an
      abstraction that lets you write powerful automations with simple human-readable commands and minimum overhead.</p>

      <p>The power of Robot Framework comes from its ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community. It is
      the world’s most popular and widely used framework for open-source RPA.</p>`
    },
    benefits: {
      title: 'Why use it and what can you do with it?',
      body: `<p>Robot Framework and its ecosystem projects are 100% free and open-source. It is used
      by thousands of developers worldwide and the core Robot Framework is supported by dozens of
      companies through the Robot Framework foundation. Hundreds of companies globally offer support
      and services in the Robot Framework ecosystem.</p>

      <p>Robot Framework is natively extendable through libraries that are built on Python.
      Creating new extensions is extremely simple, so you never run out of capabilities. Community-built
      libraries around Robot Framework provide the functionality to perform virtually any RPA task imaginable.</p>

      <p>There are literally tens of thousands of use-cases for RPA with Robot Framework. Anything
      from automating financial processes like accounts payable, order to cash, procure to pay,
      to healthcare applications around electronic health records, or HR applications such as new employee
      onboarding. You can complete any routine task that a human would do through digital workers built on the Robot Framework.</p>`
